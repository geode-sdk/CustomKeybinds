# Custom Keybinds

Adds support for customizing keybinds in the editor and while playing.

> This mod used to be required for other mods with custom keybindings to work, but since 2.208 this mod is only required if you want to customize **vanilla keybindings** (the keybindings in the editor and while playing)
